## Development
We have used the machine learing algorithm to predict the output by turbines at the wind farm according to selected date by the user. We have used the service files to serve the background processing of the data.

We have also done the analysis of the location by providing the weather conditions and representing them in form of graph (Average wind speed and average rainfall per month).
