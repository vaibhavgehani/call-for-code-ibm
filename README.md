# Development

We have used flask server to deploy the machine learning model to predict the active power generated by the wind farm for a particular location and for a selected time frame.

And used the pickle library to serialize and de-serialize the machine learning model object and used to fasten the process of machine learning model used in it.

# Deployment

You can connect to server with this link https://windz-flask-server.herokuapp.com

/predict route can be used to get the prediction based on the wind speed, wind direction, wind Gust and the selected date.

/ route can be used to checkout that the server is running or not response will be hello.
